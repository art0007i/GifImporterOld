# GifImporter

This is my fork of the gif importer, it tries to fit the sprite sheets into a square resolution, but it will sometimes create redundant empty frames at the end of the gif.

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that allows you to essentially import gif images. It converts gifs to a spritesheet then adds the appropriate components.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
1. Place [GifImporter.dll](https://github.com/kawaiiamber/GifImporter/releases/latest/download/GifImporter.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
